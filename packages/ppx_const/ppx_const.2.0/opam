synopsis: "Compile-time \"if\" statement for conditional inclusion of code."
description: """
This is a ppx extension which adds `if#const` and `match#const` constructs to
OCaml. They behave like normal `if` and `const`, but conditions are evaluated
at compile time and AST sections not selected are excluded from the program
completely. In conjunction with ppx_getenv, this can be used for conditional
compilation of code."""
